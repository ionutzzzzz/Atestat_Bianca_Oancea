        <div class="box" id="about">
            <p class="about">
                In the late-1940s Walt travelled to Chicago, he drew sketches of his ideas for an amusement park where
                he imagined his employees spending time with their children. Disney visited a children`s theme park,
                called Children's Fairyland in Oakland, California, this is where his idea came. People often asked him
                to let their children visit Walt Disney Studios, but Walt considered that a functional movie studio had
                little to offer to visiting fans so he wanted to offer them something more. He started to visit other
                parks for inspiration and ideas, including Tivoli Gardens in Denmark, Efteling in the Netherlands and
                Greenfield Village, Playland, and Children's Fairyland in the United States.
                At first, he imagined a small park, across the street, next to the studio, but it seemed to be a good
                idea, and worth a bigger investment, a huge centre, named Disneyland. Walt asked proficient help for his
                project and bought a 65 ha site near Anaheim in 1953.
                Once the thematic framework is established, the design process kicks into high gear. Every aspect of the
                park, from the layout of the lands to the architecture of the buildings, is carefully considered to
                evoke a sense of wonder and immersion. Attention is paid to sightlines, flow of foot traffic, and the
                integration of storytelling elements into the physical environment. The construction began in 1954.
                Simultaneously, teams work on the logistical aspects of opening the park. This includes infrastructure
                development, such as transportation systems and utilities, as well as staffing and operational planning.
                Disneyland is not just a theme park; it's a small city with its own ecosystem of employees, vendors, and
                service providers.
                As opening day approaches, anticipation mounts. Months, if not years, of planning culminate in a flurry
                of activity as the finishing touches are applied to the park. Attractions are tested, costumes are
                tailored, and final inspections are conducted to ensure everything meets Disney's exacting standards.
                Finally, the big day arrives: opening day. It's a momentous occasion filled with excitement and nervous
                energy. Disneyland was finally opened on Sunday, July 17, 1955, with thousands of people attending the
                occasion. Walter Disney gave the following dedication day speech:”To all who come to this happy place;
                welcome. Disneyland is your land. Here age relives fond memories of the past .... and here youth may
                savor the challenge and promise of the future. Disneyland is dedicated to the ideals, the dreams and the
                hard facts that have created America ... with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration
                to the entire world.” Disneyland turned to be a huge success and it has undergone a number of expansions
                and renovations adding different attractions like New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country in 1972, and
                Mickey's Toontown in 1993. As the clock strikes opening time, the gates swing open, and the park comes
                to life with a burst of color, music, and laughter.
